# RollWhere
A Web Application allowing Personal Mobility Aid (PMA) users to place icons of interest/danger for travel such as elevators/potholes. Users can then plan and save their routes and drag them away from such danger.

## Setup
### Pre-requisites:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v20.9.0 (*or above*)
### Building the app:
1. Install all dependencies in the root directory of the app.

    ```$ npm install```
1. Start up the server by running the `server.js` file. Default port for web app is `3000`

    ```$ node server.js```

That's all it takes to setup the web app on your local machine!
